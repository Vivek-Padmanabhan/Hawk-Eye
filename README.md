Hawk-Eye
========

Developed a computer simulated system for the MS Windows Platform. The objective was to replicate a real world system on the computer. We selected the “Hawk Eye” system used in cricket to simulate. The simulation uses OpenGL to render the graphical user interface for the system. It uses OpenGL event handling mechanism to provide user input through keyboard and mouse. The user input of mouse clicks and key presses affects the behavior of the system.
